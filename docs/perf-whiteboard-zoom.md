# Whiteboard zoom/pan performance — diagnosis & fix plan

Branch: `perf/whiteboard-profiling`. Symptom reported: panning ("normal
movement") and the zoom animation get janky once the board is zoomed **down to
~50%**, and worse below that. Initial guess was a rendering/compositing
bottleneck.

This doc records what the diagnosis actually found, ranked, with file:line and
a per-fix plan. It is the durable form of a multi-agent audit (6 parallel
tracers over the pan/zoom hot paths, every candidate adversarially verified
against the source — 33 findings, 31 confirmed, 2 refuted). The full verified
audit is the table in the appendix; the body is the deduped, actionable view.

## Verdict

The instinct was **half right**. The dominant cost is **CPU work on the main
thread**, not GPU compositing — and the reason 50% is special is a **hard-coded
threshold**, not anything about pixels.

There are three distinct causes, and together they explain why *both* panning
and the zoom animation degrade at 50%:

1. **The background dot grid** (primary; the actual 50% cliff) — CPU.
2. **No viewport culling** (secondary; the part the "rendering" hunch got right)
   — GPU compositing, but monotonic, not a 50% knee.
3. **Per-frame tax on every scroll event** (why *all* movement feels heavy,
   independent of zoom).

---

## 1. The dot grid — the 50% cliff

`Viewport.semanticZoomThreshold = 0.5` (`BoardModel.swift:55`), and
`isSemanticZoom` is `zoom < 0.5` (`:65`). The moment zoom drops **below** 0.5,
`BoardView.draw(_:)` switches the grid's world spacing **24px → 11px**
(`BoardView.swift:705`). Dot count scales with area, so this is a **~4.8×
(= (24/11)²) jump in a single frame** — a discontinuous knee exactly at the
zoom the user feels — and it keeps worsening as you zoom further out until the
grid blanks.

Per-frame dot count for a ~1920×1080 board:

| Zoom | World spacing | View spacing | Dots / frame |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.50 (just above) | 24px | 12.0px | ~14,400 |
| 0.49 (just below) | 11px | 5.4px | **~71,000** |
| ~0.28 (worst) | 11px | 3.1px | **~232,000** |
| <0.273 | 11px | <3px → grid off | 0 (sudden relief) |

The per-dot work, in a tight nested `while` loop, **every pan and every zoom
frame**, on the main thread (`BoardView.swift:720-734`):

```swift
let v = worldToView(...)              // fn call into TarmacKit, per dot
let dot = NSRect(...)
if dirtyRect.intersects(dot) {        // always true on full-bounds redraw → culls nothing
    NSBezierPath(ovalIn: dot).fill()  // a fresh heap allocation per dot
}
```

Every scroll sets `needsDisplay = true` on the whole view, so `draw(_:)` runs
with `dirtyRect == bounds` — the entire lattice is re-projected and re-filled,
~60×/sec, with no caching, no tiling, no GPU layer. The `intersects` test culls
nothing (it can only cull under partial-rect invalidation, which never happens)
and just adds a branch per dot. During the zoom animation the **crossing frame**
is the worst single frame: the density flip forces a full grid redraw
concurrently with `reprojectAll` + content-scale work.

**Fix (high confidence):** take `draw(_:)` off the pan/zoom hot path. Move the
grid into its own backing layer whose contents are scale/translate-invariant — a
`CGPattern`-backed (pattern color) layer or `CAReplicatorLayer` — so **pan = a
layer position change and zoom = a layer transform, both GPU, zero `draw(_:)`
calls**. Cheap interim if we stay CPU-side: batch all dots into a **single**
`CGPath`/fill (kills the ~71k–232k per-frame `NSBezierPath` allocations) and
drop the dead `intersects` test. Separately, reconsider the 24→11px density flip
— at <50% the dense dots are only 3–5px apart and barely visible, so the flip
buys little and causes the knee.

## 2. No viewport culling — the "rendering bottleneck" you sensed

Every card is a permanent live subview; there is **no `intersects(viewport)`
skip anywhere** on the reproject path (`BoardView.swift:508`). At 100% most
cards sit off-screen and AppKit skips them; zooming out maps ~4× more world area
into view, so **~4× more WKWebView/terminal cards composite simultaneously**.
This is genuine GPU compositing cost — but it rises **monotonically as 1/zoom²**,
it is **not** a sharp 50% knee (50% is just where it reaches ~4× the 100%
baseline). It compounds the grid cost when zoomed out.

**Fix (medium confidence):** explicit viewport culling — hide offscreen cards
with `isHidden` (keep the view **alive** so a WKWebView keeps scroll position
and a SwiftTerm keeps receiving PTY output; do **not** `removeFromSuperview`).
For very dense low-zoom boards, the dormant semantic-zoom "locard" path
(`CardView.swift:434`, force-disabled at `BoardView.swift:76`/`:680`) could swap
live cards for cheap name+status chips below a zoom threshold — but that is a UX
reversal of the documented infinite-canvas model and is out of scope unless we
choose it deliberately.

## 3. Per-frame tax — why *all* movement feels heavy

These fire on **every scroll event** regardless of zoom (flat w.r.t. zoom):

- **`persistLayout` runs on every scroll delta.** `scrollWheel` calls
  `onLayoutChanged?` unconditionally (`BoardView.swift:653`) — unlike `magnify`,
  which commits only on `.ended`. That rebuilds the full layout snapshot
  (`board.boardDocPaths.sorted()` afresh each event, term/shelf/dock arrays),
  **msgpack-encodes it synchronously on the main thread**, and writes an IPC
  frame to the daemon — per scroll delta. (There is already a `TODO(perf)` at
  `AppController.swift:351`.) **Fix:** debounce (trailing ~200ms) or persist on
  scroll phase `.ended`/momentum `.ended`, flushed on resignActive/terminate and
  board switch.
- **`refreshWayfinding` runs twice per event.** `reprojectAll` fires
  `onCardsChanged` (`BoardView.swift:514`) *and* `scrollWheel` fires
  `onViewportChanged` (`:652`); both are wired to `refreshWayfinding`
  (`RootView.swift:109-110`). Each rebuilds the minimap (all card rects) and
  **tears down + recreates all offscreen-hint pill `NSView`s**
  (`OffscreenHints.swift:52-87`) and iterates all cards
  (`AppController.swift:1659`). **Fix:** coalesce to one refresh per frame
  (dirty flag / display-link); don't fire `onCardsChanged` on a pure pan (the
  card *set* didn't change, only the viewport); diff the pills instead of
  rebuilding.
- **A fresh `DateFormatter` per provenance edge, every pan frame.**
  `recomputeEdges` → `edgeLabel` allocates and configures a new `DateFormatter`
  per doc edge (`AppController.swift:2417`) — ICU setup is notoriously
  expensive. **Fix:** cache one shared formatter; better, the label is
  viewport-invariant, so recompute labels only on card-set/`lastOpenedMs`
  change and update only projected geometry on pan.
- **`updateLocards` loops all cards every frame** to set a value that never
  changes (locards are off) (`BoardView.swift:679`). **Fix:** remove from the
  per-frame path.
- **`refreshFloatingClose` does an O(cards) scan + coordinate-convert every
  reproject** (`BoardView.swift:522`). **Fix:** recompute on focus change, not
  every pan.
- **`updateContentScaleIfNeeded` walks every card's full layer tree on every
  *zoom* step**, even when the computed scale is unchanged (it is constant below
  100%) (`BoardView.swift:578` → `CardView.swift:184`). Pan-gated correctly, so
  zoom-only. **Fix:** per-card early-return when `scale == pendingContentScale`.
- **Micro:** `project()` calls `setBoundsSize` unconditionally every frame
  (`BoardView.swift:619`); guard `if card.bounds.size != worldSize`. Low value
  (world size is constant except on resize) but cheap insurance.

---

## Verified non-issues (do not touch)

- **SwiftTerm does not re-measure cols/rows on pan/zoom** — the crib comment at
  `BoardView.swift:608-616` is correct; bounds stay world-fixed, so the terminal
  only re-measures on an actual resize (`CardChrome.swift:476`).
- **No Auto Layout inside cards** — all manual frame-setting, no constraint
  solve on frame change (`CardView.swift:506`). Deliberate and correct.
- **`restack()`** (removeFromSuperview+addSubview per card) is O(N) but fires
  only on add / gesture-commit, **not** on the pan/zoom frame
  (`BoardView.swift:498`).

## Refuted hypotheses

- **"The zoom animation's `asyncAfter(1/60)` self-rearming chain is the
  bottleneck."** Refuted — `animateViewport` is reached **only** via `flyTo`
  (⏎/esc fly-to), an occasional discrete keyboard action. The continuous
  pan/zoom hot path is `scrollWheel`/`magnify`, which reproject synchronously in
  the event callback. (A display-link rewrite would still smooth the fly
  animation, but it is not the movement-time cost.)
- **"`applyDocZoomScale` re-rasterizes WebKit on pan."** Refuted — double-gated:
  zoom-change gated upstream (`updateContentScaleIfNeeded`) and scale-change
  gated internally (`DocWebView.swift:121`). The doc device-scale override is
  constant below 100% zoom, so it never re-rasters on the way down.

## Fix plan (one commit each, ranked)

| # | Fix | Kind | Confidence | Notes / risk |
|---|-----|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | ✅ **Done** — grid is one cached-tile blit (`CGContext.draw(_:in:byTiling:)`) instead of N path fills | refactor (visual-preserving) | high | **Killed the cliff: `draw` 40ms→0.03ms @0.49, 124ms→0.02ms @0.28.** Pixel-faithful (AA-only diff, verified by snapshot). 24→11px flip kept — tiling made it free, so no UX change needed. |
| 2 | ✅ **Done** — `persistLayout` debounced on a 200ms trailing timer | behavior change | high | A pan burst now does 1 snapshot+IPC, not 1/event. Flushed on switch-away / resignActive / terminate so the last position is never dropped. Not benchmark-measurable (sweep drives reprojectAll directly). |
| 3 | ✅ **Done** — dropped reprojectAll's redundant `onCardsChanged` | refactor | high | One wayfinding refresh/frame, not two (`wayfind n` 100→50 / 50 frames). `onCardsChanged` kept on real set-mutation; `layout()` refreshes via `onViewportChanged`. Pill-diff deemed unneeded (no signal pills in steady state). |
| 4 | ✅ **Done** — cached the shared HH:mm `DateFormatter` | refactor | high | Was a fresh DateFormatter per doc-edge per frame (ICU/locale load). Residual per-edge work negligible after, so the "memoize labels" step was skipped deliberately. |
| 5 | ✅ **Done** — cull offscreen cards via `isHidden` | behavior change (perf) | medium | Views stay alive (WKWebView scroll + pty intact); hidden >1 viewport off-screen. `liveCards` 35/42 @1.0 in the clustered sweep. Compositing win, not reproject CPU. **Manual check worth doing:** pan a large multi-card board for pop-in. |
| 6 | ✅ **Done** — content-scale walk early-returns when scale unchanged | refactor | high | `force` flag for attachTerminal's grown subtree. Render-identical (snapshot diff). |
| 7 | ✅ **Done** — skip `refreshFloatingClose` scan on terminal-only boards | refactor | medium | Via a doc-card count. Full focus-gating deferred (would need focus state the board doesn't track; risk > the µs gain). |
| 8 | ✅ **Done** — removed `updateLocards` per-frame calls | cleanup | high | Dead loop in this model; function retained, uncalled. |
| 9 | ✅ **Done** — `setBoundsSize` guarded on size change | refactor | high | Skips a layout pass per card per frame; world size changes only on resize. Render-identical (snapshot diff). |

**Testability.** The app layer is not unit-tested (only TarmacKit is). Extract
the pure decision logic into TarmacKit and unit-test it there: the
visible-card/culling predicate (#5), the dot-lattice visible-range computation
(#1), and the pan-commit gating (#2). The rest is verified by instrumentation +
manual run, not unit tests.

## Instrumentation — done (`PerfTrace.swift`)

The branch is named for profiling — measure before/after so each fix is
justified by numbers, not assertion. Implemented as a removable two-channel
profiler (`app/Sources/TarmacApp/PerfTrace.swift`):

- **os_signpost** intervals/events (always live, near-free) around `draw(_:)`
  (with the dot count `gridDots`), `reprojectAll`, `recomputeEdges`, and
  `persistLayout` — record against subsystem `dev.tarmac.perf` in Instruments.
- A **stderr aggregator** behind `TARMAC_PERF=1` that prints rolling
  n/mean/p95/max per key, plus `visibleCards`/`totalCards` gauges (the 1/zoom²
  curve and the culling headroom for #5).
- A scripted **benchmark** behind `TARMAC_PERF_BENCH=1`: populates ~42 synthetic
  cards, sweeps zoom 1.0 / 0.51 / 0.49 / 0.28 forcing a synchronous grid redraw
  per pan step, and prints one labelled line per level — no GUI interaction
  needed (synthetic trackpad events get dropped without an Accessibility grant).
  Drives `reprojectAll` directly, never persists. `TARMAC_PERF_BENCH=1 make run`,
  or run the binary directly for an isolated, daemon-less capture.

### Measured baseline (2026-06-16, `TARMAC_PERF_BENCH`, 80 panned frames/level, 42 cards)

| zoom | grid | `gridDots` | `draw` mean (p95 / max) | `reproject` mean | `edges` mean | visible / total |
|------|------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1.00 | 24px | 1,440  | **1.97ms** (2.2 / 2.3)   | 0.76ms | 0.02ms | 8 / 42  |
| 0.51 | 24px | 5,225  | **7.80ms** (8.3 / 13.7)  | 0.93ms | 0.03ms | 22 / 42 |
| 0.49 | 11px | 26,137 | **40.51ms** (43 / 47)    | 0.93ms | 0.03ms | 23 / 42 |
| 0.28 | 11px | 79,183 | **128.85ms** (159 / 263) | 1.81ms | 0.03ms | 40 / 42 |

What the numbers settle:

- **The grid IS the bottleneck.** `draw` dwarfs `reproject` by 20–70×. The
  0.50 threshold flip (24→11px) makes 0.51→0.49 jump `draw` **7.8ms → 40.5ms
  (5.2×)** for a **5× dot-count jump** — this is the "broken at 50%" cliff,
  measured. By 0.28 the grid alone is ~129ms/frame (~8fps).
- **Culling (#5) is real but secondary.** Only 8/42 cards are on-screen at 100%
  (81% cullable), yet `reproject` stays sub-2ms even at 40 visible — so #5 is a
  smaller win than the grid, and helps least when zoomed out (where everything's
  on-screen and the grid dominates anyway). NB: these are *bare* cards; real
  WKWebView/terminal reprojection is heavier than measured here.
- **`edges` geometry is negligible** (~0.03ms) — but the synthetic docs carry no
  label, so this does *not* exercise the per-edge `DateFormatter` alloc (#4);
  that cost only appears with real labelled doc cards.
- **`persist` isn't in the sweep** (it drives `reprojectAll` directly to avoid
  writing junk layouts); capture it from a real `TARMAC_PERF=1 make run` session.

Re-run this same benchmark after each fix for an apples-to-apples before/after.

### After fix #1 — tiled grid (same benchmark, 50 frames/level)

| zoom | `gridDots` | `draw` before | `draw` after | speedup |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1.00 | 1,440  | 1.99ms   | **0.01ms** | ~200×  |
| 0.51 | 5,150  | 7.64ms   | **0.03ms** | ~250×  |
| 0.49 | 25,725 | 39.92ms  | **0.03ms** | ~1,300× |
| 0.28 | 78,149 | 124.48ms | **0.02ms** | ~6,000× |

The grid is now constant-time (one tiled blit) regardless of dot count — the
0.50 cliff is gone, and `draw` is no longer the frame's dominant cost at any
zoom. `gridDots` is unchanged (same lattice math), and the render is
pixel-faithful: a before/after snapshot diff shows only dot anti-aliasing
(`max_px_delta` pinned at the faint dot-vs-background contrast; cards/edges
identical), confirmed visually at 0.49 and 0.28. The 24→11px density flip is
retained — tiling made it free, so the prescribed "revisit the flip" UX change
isn't needed. The tile rebuilds only when zoom or backing scale changes (a tiny
≤~150px image); during a pure pan it's a cache hit. With the grid removed as the
bottleneck, the next dominant per-frame cost is `reproject` (0.7–1.8ms, scaling
with visible card count → fix #5) and, in real use, the `persist` IPC (#2).
